# Unity-MLFetch
A small ML-Agents project to become familiar with the basics of machine learning in Unity, based on the ML-Agents 0.3 beta.

This project was a small experiment of mine, aiming to create a lean ML enviroment where an agent can chase a target, and return to its starting position. In essence the model is trained to fetch. 

This project includes the Unity Enviroment only! To get access to the full Unity ML Agents for training models and setting up observations, see Unity's repo [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).
